Bitte schau dir den Prompt an und schau dir an was wir bisher geschafft und implementiert haben. Gibt es noch etwas, was fehlt?

# AI Review
Based on the review of the implemented code, the Link Dashboard project has successfully met most of the core requirements outlined in the original prompt. The application includes:

1. A responsive frontend with tile and list views for links
2. Dark and light mode functionality
3. Add, edit, and delete capabilities for links
4. Search and tag filtering features
5. A detailed view for each link
6. A backend server using Express.js and SQLite for data storage and retrieval

To fully complete the project and enhance its functionality, consider implementing the following improvements:

1. Performance optimization: Implement pagination or lazy loading to handle large numbers of links efficiently.
2. Enhanced error handling: Improve error messages and handling for a better user experience.
3. Input validation: Add server-side validation to ensure data integrity and security.
4. Favicon handling: Implement backend support for storing and retrieving favicons.
5. Automated testing: Develop unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend.
6. Link categorization: Enhance the tagging system or add categories for better organization.
7. User authentication: Implement multi-user support with secure authentication.
8. Import/export functionality: Allow users to backup and restore their link collections.
9. Usage analytics: Add features to track and display link usage statistics.

These enhancements will make the Link Dashboard more robust, secure, and feature-rich, fully realizing the potential of the original project concept.
